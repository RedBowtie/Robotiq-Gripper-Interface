# Robotiq-Gripper-Interface
Gripper Interface in MATLAB/Python, tested on JHU Wyman Robotiq 2F-85, via TCP/IP protocal.

<code>UR Cap</code> for Robotiq gripper has to be installed to the teaching pendant. Official UR Cap may have wider compatibility range, YMMV.

In terms of powering and wiring, it is recommended to refer to the [official manual](https://blog.robotiq.com/hubfs/support-files/2F-85_2F-140_UR_PDF_20240402.pdf).
